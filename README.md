# Cribbed from jba

This fork of the origin repo is just so I can compare with the output
of [emperror](https://github.com/emperror/emperror), and [cockroachdb/errors](https://github.com/cockroachdb/errors)

+ [emperror output example](https://play.golang.org/p/OUrwpogR8_E)

# Example of detailed error formatting

This repo holds a sample implementation of detailed error formatting.

It accompanies my GopherCon 2020 talk, "Working with Error Wrapping".

The code here is for demo purposes only; it hasn't been thoroughly tested, and
I'm not sure I like the choice of names. That's why I put it into an internal
package.
