# Example of detailed error formatting

This repo holds a sample implementation of detailed error formatting.

It accompanies my GopherCon 2020 talk, "Working with Error Wrapping".

The code here is for demo purposes only; it hasn't been thoroughly tested, and
I'm not sure I like the choice of names. That's why I put it into an internal
package.
